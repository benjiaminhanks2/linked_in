= linked_in

== DESCRIPTION:

The linked_in gem wraps the LinkedIn API making it easy to read and write profile information and messages on http://linked_in.com. Full support for OAuth is provided including a wrapper for Pelle's oauth-plugin (http://github.com/pelle/oauth-plugin/). This gem borrowed heavily from junemakers twitter gem (http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter/). 

== SYNOPSIS:
	
To authorize via oauth:

	oauth = LinkedIn::OAuth.new('token', 'secret') # => #<LinkedIn::OAuth:0x1021db048 ...> 
	
	oauth.request_token.authorize_url # => "https://api.linked_in.com/uas/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=XXXX" 
	
Visit authorization URL, authorize and copy PIN
	
	oauth.authorize_from_request(oauth.request_token.token, oauth.request_token.secret, PIN)

Then do stuff (like request your profile):

	oauth.profile # => {'first-name' => 'Peter', 'last-name' => 'Brown' ...}
